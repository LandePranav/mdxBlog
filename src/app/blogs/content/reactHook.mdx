# React Hooks Overview

**React Hooks** provide a way to use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Commonly Used Hooks

1. **useState**: Manages state in functional components.
2. **useEffect**: Handles side effects like fetching data.
3. **useContext**: Accesses React context directly.

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
